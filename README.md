Retail Sales Performance Analysis – Power BI Project

This project analyzes nationwide retail sales data using Power BI to uncover revenue trends, profitability gaps, and product performance across multiple regions and categories.

The dataset includes sales transactions along with customer and product information, modeled using a star schema to ensure efficient analysis and accurate reporting. Data cleaning was performed using Power Query to handle missing values, duplicates, and validation issues.

Interactive dashboards were built across multiple pages to visualize:

Overall sales, profit, and margin performance using KPI cards

Regional and category-wise revenue comparison

Sales and profit distribution through univariate analysis

Product-level profitability to identify high and low performing items

DAX measures were implemented to calculate Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin (%), enabling dynamic business insights.

Key Insights:

Identified regions with high revenue but low profit margins
